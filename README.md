## 🚀 Project: [Your Project Title Here, e.g., "Credit Risk Analysis and Default Prediction"]

This section details the repository's capstone project.

* **Objective:** "The aim here will be to predict the medical costs billed by health insurance on an individual given some features about the individual in the dataset."
* **Dataset:** "The dataset was sourced from a public  dataset on Kaggle "
* **Methodology:** This project follows a standard data science workflow:
    1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values (e.g., using mean imputation) and corrected data types.
    2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized feature distributions and correlations to identify key predictors.
    3.  **Feature Engineering:** Created new features (e.g., debt-to-income ratio) to improve model performance.
    4.  **Modeling:** Trained and evaluated several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
    5.  **Evaluation:** Used metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and the **AUC-ROC curve** to select the best-performing model, paying close attention to the cost of false negatives.
* **Key Findings:** [Summarize the result. e.g., "The final XGBoost model achieved an AUC score of 0.82, successfully identifying key drivers of default, such as..."]
